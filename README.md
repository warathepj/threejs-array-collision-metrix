# 3D Collision Detection Demo

A simple Three.js-based demonstration of 3D collision detection between objects using Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision checking and a collision matrix system.

## Features

- Real-time 3D rendering using Three.js
- AABB collision detection between two cubes
- Collision counter display
- Orbit controls for camera manipulation
- Collision matrix implementation for tracking object interactions

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Internet connection (for loading Three.js from CDN)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/warathepj/threejs-array-collision-metrix.git

   ```

2. Serve the files using a local web server. For example, using Python:

```bash

# Python 3 python -m http.server

# Python 2

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000

```

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with Three.js imports and scene container
- `index.js` - Main JavaScript file containing Three.js scene setup and collision logic
- `collision/ArrayCollisionMatrix.js` - Implementation of the collision matrix system

  TODO:

## Controls

- Left click + drag: Rotate camera- Right click + drag: Pan camera
- Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out

## Technical Details

The demo uses:- Three.js for 3D rendering

- OrbitControls for camera manipulation- Custom collision matrix implementation
- AABB collision detection
